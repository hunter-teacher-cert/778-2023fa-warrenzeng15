Nefarious idea:  
Using this map of bicycle parking spots: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/Bicycle-Parking/yh4a-g3fj, an app can be designed to notify others of bikes that are currently parked. Criminals that are using the app and monitoring
these parking spots can detail how expensive the bike looks, as well as how easy it is to break the bike chains/locks, aiding would-be bike thieves in stealing the bikes. With enough criminals using the app, and potentially a way to upload photos on the app,
you could create an app that can stalk bikes across the city and figure out the optimal time/opportunity of stealing it. 


Controversial idea:  
Using this data: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j, (which is also linked with this map: https://a816-health.nyc.gov/ABCEatsRestaurants/#!/Search), 
you can create an app that lists the diffrent restuarants that have "Grade Pending". Actively impersonating a health inspector is a crime, of course, but using this app you could simply enter these "Grade Pending" restaurants wearing a nice set of clothes
and a clipboard or something that would make workers think that you are inspecting them, even if you actually aren't. You might get treated nicer and/or receive free food this way. I think this counts as controversial instead of strictly nefarious,
as it is simply going to potentially cause a restaurant to be on their best behavior befitting of the Grade that they want to get.


Beneficial idea:  
Using this data set: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Business/SBS-Certified-Business-List/ci93-uc8s, an app can be created that has a map of all the Minority and/or Women-owned Business Enterprises. 
It can filter by the different categories of businesses, but personally I think it would be best to have it focus on small restaurants. This will allow people using the app to support restaurants owned by 
women and minorities.
