## Lockdown browser/spyware tools for remote test administrataion

After the covid-19 pandemic, there was as necessity to develop a way to have students sit down and do assessements remotely. This eventually led to the creation of the lockdown browser that would prevent students from going onto other programs on their personal devices in order to prevent cheating. There are also a number of other features of these browsers/spyware tools that were created for the purpose of administering assessments, and much of it can be considered unethical.  

The main points that I have **against** these tools are the following:  
- invasion of privacy
- psychological impact on student's test taking abilities
- exaacerbates inequities for students in terms of equipment
- problems with the software itself

Generally speaking, these browsers are an invasion of privacy as many of them require a 360 degree scan of test taker's rooms. For many people, testing at home would be the only option, in which case they would have to show off their room to the proctors/testing software. These programs also sometimes records camera video, audio, and pays close attention to you as you take the exam. (In fact, some of these software actually record the sessions!)

As such, there will be a negative psychological impact on student's test taking abilities. Their anxieties will increase out of fear of the test taking software incorrectly flagging them for cheataing, and may make them perform lower than they normally would. Being closely monitored by your computer is bound to have an affect on a student's performance.

Lockdown browsers exacerbate inequities for students. Some students may not have appropriate equipment in order to use the software, in which case they would need to find another device or borrow one. Students with older equipment may experience more errors in their devices if they freeze or glitch. There's also an issue with wifi connections -- students with poorer connections may experience more difficulties with lockdown browsers. It's so bad that even bad lighting in a room could cause problems during an exam.

As for any computer software, there may be bugs and glitches with the software itself. Troubleshooting things in the middle of an exam is an annoyance and could break people's focus. Sometimes, if there is an issue that can't be fixed, the student may not even be able to complete the exam at the time.
