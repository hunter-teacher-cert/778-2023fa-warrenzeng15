## Ethics Final Project - City Transportation

This is a project I worked on with Emile Jean Baptiste.
It involved writing a program that would help us analyze bus and train routes, which we could use to draw conclusions on where our city's transportation needs more help.

For more context, please view the PowerPoint slides that is titled, "Final Presentation - City Transportation Analysis"

Here are also the maps that showcase the results we got:
