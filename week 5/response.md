We didn't really get a chance to do any of the excercises during classtime. Based off of what I can read in the notes and the kinds of excercises that we are doing for the rest of homework/async, it seems that the ethics part of it is really about the use of 
public data. Lots of debates can be had as to whether a certain piece of data is ethical to be shared publicly. As we saw last week, any person can take public data and come up with good/helpful ideas for society, but at the very same time a person could easily
come up with malicious or controversial ideas/apps that can do harm to others. You can't possibly expect every single person to be a good actor with public data, so there comes the question of what data should and can be publicly available, in an effort to avoid
the worst case scenarios. In the payroll, liquor authority, and lottery examples from the excercises, we could debate about whether or not people should have easy access to that information. The one that would be most debatable will obviously be the payroll one,
as there is already an on-going culture where bosses do not want employees to discuss salaries with other employees at the same company (which apparently is illegal in NYS). Being able to find someone's name as well as their salary would obviously bypass this kind of
culture, so there will obviously be people against the fact that it is public data, as well as people who are all for it.
