Using the existing code as a base, my idea to improve upon the equity/ethical concerns of the program are to make seat assigning "block" based for regular economy passengers.  

What I mean by that is that regular economy passengers traveling in groups will get seated next to each other. (If there is a family of 3 or a group of 3 people that bought tickets together, the program will search through each row
for a arow with 3 available seats, and then seat those passengers. If a passenger is alone, they simply get any available seat.) 
Economy plus passengers will continue to get priority seating for windows, as well as the front rows of the plane. In an ideal world, economy plus passengers would be able to
pick their seats outright instead of having them assigned, but if we are to maintain the assigning nature of the program, I am choosing to have them simply just take an available seat either at a window seat or the front rows of the plane.  

At a certain point, it will reach a point where economy passengers will just be assigned whatever seat is available, and passengers traveling in groups will be split up. In a sense, this model of seating is very much
first come first serve based, which I think is a good way to balance the seating arrangements as well.
